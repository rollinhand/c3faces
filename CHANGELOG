# C3Faces Changelog
This is the official changelog for C3Faces JSF library.

## 1.1
Added support for axis of type category. Use the new tags _axes_, _axisX_ and _axisY_ for
a clean design of your axis. You can use the following attributes on axisX and axisY:

- use _show_ with parameter false to hide the X- or Y-axis.
- use _type_ with parameter _indexed_ or _category_ to define the axis type.
- use _categories_ with an array of your defined category names. This has only an effect if _type_ is _category_.
- use _height_ to adjust the height of the axis.
- _localtime_ is supported by defining with values false or true. But the attribute has currently no effect.
localtime will be supported in an upcoming release.

Have a look at the official [showcase](http://c3faces.kivio.org) for more details on using C3Faces.

## 1.0
This is the first official release of C3Faces as forked version from Marin Linha.
Changes are done on sources to release it under Apache 2.0 license and c3.js was
changed to version 0.4.18.
