# C3Faces Changelog
This is the official changelog for C3Faces JSF library.

## 1.3
This is a small enhancement release containing the following updates:

- Extended faces-config.xml declaring _components_ from the taglib matching
requirements defined by older versions of JSF and Spring Boot. Background
information demanding this fix can be found
[here](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19575-01/819-3669/bnawo/index.html).
- It is now possible to select pre-defined colors and themes for much
more harmonius colours in charts. Therefore the classes _C3Color_ and
_C3Theme_ were introduced. _C3Theme_ contains themes used in Microsoft Excel
or LibreOffice Spreadsheet. Showcase does not reflect this change so feel free
playing around with this classes.

## 1.2
Bugfix for categories

## 1.1
Added support for axis of type category. Use the new tags _axes_, _axisX_ and _axisY_ for
a clean design of your axis. You can use the following attributes on axisX and axisY:

- use _show_ with parameter false to hide the X- or Y-axis.
- use _type_ with parameter _indexed_ or _category_ to define the axis type.
- use _categories_ with an array of your defined category names. This has only an effect if _type_ is _category_.
- use _height_ to adjust the height of the axis.
- _localtime_ is supported by defining with values false or true. But the attribute has currently no effect.
localtime will be supported in an upcoming release.

Have a look at the official [showcase](http://c3faces.kivio.org) for more details on using C3Faces.

## 1.0

Changes are done on sources to release it under Apache 2.0 license and c3.js was
changed to version 0.4.18.
